Algorithm Performance Dashboard
🚀 Project Overview
Welcome to the Algorithm Performance Dashboard! This tool is designed to evaluate and compare the efficiency of different algorithms across various datasets. The dashboard provides an interactive interface that allows users to visualize execution time, space complexity, and other important performance metrics of multiple algorithms in real-time.

Whether you're a student, researcher, or developer, this project is built to help you analyze the speed and efficiency of algorithms, making it an ideal tool for learning and performance testing.

✨ Key Features
📊 Visualize Algorithm Performance: View and compare execution times and space usage across different algorithms using interactive graphs.

🧑‍💻 Custom Algorithm Testing: Test and analyze the performance of your own algorithms by providing input and selecting dataset types.

🔍 Detailed Analysis: Track and understand key metrics such as time complexity, space complexity, and other efficiency parameters.

📈 Interactive Dashboard: A user-friendly interface to allow dynamic interaction with algorithm data and real-time updates.

📤 Export Results: Export the performance data as CSV or PDF reports for further analysis or sharing.
