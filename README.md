# Algorithm Performance Dashboard

## Overview
The **Algorithm Performance Dashboard** allows you to analyze and compare the performance of different algorithms in real-time. It provides insights into **execution time**, **space complexity**, and other key metrics for various algorithms. This project is perfect for anyone looking to understand the efficiency of algorithms and how they perform on different datasets.

---

## Features
- **Visualize Performance**: Compare execution time and space complexity across algorithms.
- **Custom Algorithm Testing**: Analyze your own algorithms.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Easy-to-use interface with dynamic charts.
- **Export Results**: Save performance data as CSV or PDF.

---

## Supported Algorithms
- **Sorting**: QuickSort, MergeSort, BubbleSort, InsertionSort, HeapSort
- **Searching**: Binary Search, Linear Search, Jump Search
- **Graph**: Dijkstra’s, Kruskal’s, BFS, DFS
- **Custom**: Test your own algorithms

## How to Use
1. **Clone the repo**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/AlgorithmPerformanceDashboard.git
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd AlgorithmPerformanceDashboard
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the app**:
