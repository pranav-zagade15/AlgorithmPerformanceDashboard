AlgorithmPerformanceDashboard

Introduction
The AlgorithmPerformanceDashboard is a versatile tool designed to analyze, compare, and visualize the performance of various algorithms. It provides insights into their execution time, space complexity, and overall efficiency. This project aims to help developers, students, and researchers choose the most suitable algorithm for their specific needs based on data-driven performance metrics.

Features
Algorithm Performance Metrics:
Measure execution time and space utilization.
Evaluate performance across different data sizes and types.
Interactive Dashboard:
Visualize results using graphs and charts.
Intuitive interface for easy comparisons.
Custom Algorithm Integration:
Add and test user-defined algorithms.
Compare them with standard algorithms.
Comprehensive Reporting:
Generate detailed reports on performance metrics.
Export results in various formats (e.g., CSV, PDF).
Real-World Applications:
Understand algorithm efficiency for sorting, searching, and optimization problems.
Tailor algorithms to specific use cases.
Key Algorithms Supported
Sorting: QuickSort, MergeSort, BubbleSort.
